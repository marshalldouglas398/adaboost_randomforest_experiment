# adaboost_randomforest_experiment

This is a project that I did in high school. It is an experiment that I ran to compare AdaBoost and
Random Forest at multi-class classification tasks. I wrote a research paper evaluating all of the
metrics that I recorded.

This code was refactored because the original program was BAD.

The program works with sklearn built-in datasets. It trains machine learning algorithms on the data. 
Then it calculates several common machine learning metrics and graphs them for comparison.

This program uses the libraries: 
 - time
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - sklearn
